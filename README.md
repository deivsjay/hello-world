learning to make a repository for the first time

My name is Divya Jagadeesh. I am a first year Master's student at the University of Southern California. I received my B.S. in Mathematics from Penn State University. I am currently on USC Zeher. In addition I work for USC's Joint Educational Program. I tutor Title I elementary school students in Mathematics. I'm blessed for the opportunities I've been given.
